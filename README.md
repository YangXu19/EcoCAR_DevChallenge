# EcoCAR_DevChallenge
My application to be a member on the CAVS (Connected and Autonomous Vehicles) subteam for EcoCAR

## The Problem
Should self-driving cars be fully autonomous? 

## The Idea
During inclement weather conditions like when it is raining or during a snowstorm, it is too dangerous to rely on self-driving technology. Therefore, I designed a system that detects how dangerous the driving conditions are during inclement weather and disables auto-pilot functionalities when the driving conditions are too dangerous.

## Technologies Used
-Arduino
-Water sensor
-LEDs (red, yellow, green)
-Motor driver
-Brushless DC motors
